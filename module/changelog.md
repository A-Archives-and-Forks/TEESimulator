# Initial release of TEESimulator

TEESimulator is forked from [TrickyStoreOSS](https://github.com/beakthoven/TrickyStoreOSS) with the ambitious plan to fully simulate TEE.

Current release only marks the beginning of this project.
A new feature is added, which allows users to configure multiple keybox files.
